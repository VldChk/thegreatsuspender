# Legacy code

The original Manifest V2 Great Suspender implementation is retained only for
reference and historical comparison. It now lives under
`legacy/original-mv2/` and is not part of the supported build pipeline.

The active, privacy-first extension is the Manifest V3 rewrite inside
`local-suspender/`. All packaging instructions target that folder and the
legacy sources should not be built or shipped.
